## FAQ

### Q: How to scrobble music to LastFM, LibreFM, ListenBrainz or GNU FM?

Use other music scrobbler apps. I
recommend [Pano Scrobbler](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.arn.scrobble).

### Q: Why OuterTune isn't showing in Android Auto?

1. Go to Android Auto's settings and tap multiple times on the version in the bottom to enable
   developer settings
2. In the three dots menu at the top-right of the screen, click "Developer settings"
3. Enable "Unknown sources"
