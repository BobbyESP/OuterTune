## FAQ

### Q: How to scrobble music to LastFM, LibreFM, ListenBrainz or GNU FM?

Use other music scrobbler apps. I
recommend [Pano Scrobbler](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.arn.scrobble).

### Q: Why OuterTune isn't showing in Android Auto?

1. Go to Android Auto's settings and tap multiple times on the version in the bottom to enable
   developer settings
2. In the three dots menu at the top-right of the screen, click "Developer settings"
3. Enable "Unknown sources"

## Building with FFmpeg (non-kit)

By default, we ship a prebuilt library (`/app/prebuilt/ffMetadataEx.arr`), and you *do not* need to care about this.
However, should you choose to opt for self built libraries and/or work on the extractor itself, keep reading:

1. First you will need to setup the [Android NDK](https://developer.android.com/studio/projects/install-ndk)

2. We use FFMpeg to extract metadata from local files. The FFMpeg (non-kit) implementation must be resolved in one of two ways:
   
   - a) Build libraries. Clone [ffmpeg-android-maker](https://github.com/Javernaut/ffmpeg-android-maker) into `/ffMetadataEx/src/main/cpp/ffmpeg-android-maker`, run the build script. Note: It may be helpful to modify the FFmpeg build script disable uneeded FFmpeg fetaures to reduce app size, see [here](https://github.com/mikooomich/ffmpeg-android-maker/blob/master/scripts/ffmpeg/build.sh) for an example.
  
   - b) Use prebuilt FFmpeg libraries. Clone [prebuilt ffmpeg-android-maker](https://github.com/mikooomich/ffmpeg-android-maker-prebuilt) into `/ffMetadataEx/src/main/cpp/ffmpeg-android-maker`.

3. Modify `app/build.gradle.kts` and `settings.gradle.kts` to switch to the self built version, with the instructions being in both of the files

Then start the build are you normally would.
